    "\n",
    "We must all be familiar with types. They are fundamental to most of the programming languages that we have\n",
    "seen thus far. Let us take a language such as Java.  Whenever we write a class, function definition or declare\n",
    "a variable, we need to tell Java its type, even if obvious to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "class Hello {\n",
    "  public int y;\n",
    "  public Hello (Hello h){\n",

    "You see that every declaration introduces the type of the thing that has been declared. `y` is declared to be an `int`. `h` the argument in the constructor of class `Hello` has type `Hello`. The return type of function `foo` is a `String` and its argument `x` has type `int`. \n",

A static type system would rule out such an error automatically without having to run your program since it would object passing a dictionary to a function that expects a string as an input. Recognizing this, Python 3.6 added support for type hints, which serve as a makeshift static type system for Python.\n",

    "## Examples of Welltyped vs. Mistyped Expressions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To motivate our study, let us start with various examples of welltyped vs. mistyped expressions (programs).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Mistyped Program \n",

    "let x = 10 in \n",
    "   if (x) then True else False\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mistyped because x is used as a Boolean in the `if-then-else` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Welltyped Program \n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let x = 10 in \n",
    "   if (x >= 9) then 1 else 2\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of the program as a whole is __num__ since it returns a numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Mistyped Program\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let f =  function (x) \n",
    "    if (x >= 10) \n",
    "    then 9\n",
    "    else false\n",
    " in f(10)\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The program is considered mistyped since the function `f` does not have a definite return type: it returns a number or a boolean depending on the value of `x`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that such functions were perfectly OK thus far. So the decision to call them mistyped can be considered controversial. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Mistyped Program\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let f = 10 in \n",
    "   f (20) // This is FunCall\n",
    "~~~\n",

    "\n",
    "So if we said  that only terminating program can be well  typed: checking whether a program is well typed will become equivalent to solving the halting problem, which is not easy. Therefore, we will side step this issue for now. The situation is not as dire as one may think. It is certainly possible to design systems in which only terminating recursions can be defined. However, this is outside the scope of our studies in this class.\n",

    "- __bool__ is the type of all expressions that yield a Boolean value in $\\mathbb{B}$.\n",
    "- __t1 => t2__ denotes a function type, wherein t1 and t2 are types.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will skip a type for __error__. It is a value that will only be encountered at runtime and we will never\n",
    "intentionally create __error__ in our language. So it will make no sense to have it as a valid type in our type system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Const(10.0)` has type __num__\n",
    "- `Const(True)` has type __bool__\n",
    "- `Plus(Const(10), Const(5))` has type __num__\n",
    "- `Minus(Const(10), Const(True))` has no type in our system since it is a mistyped epression.\n",
    "- `And( Geq(Const(10.0), Const(5.0)), Eq(Const(True), Const(False)) )` has type __bool__\n",
    "- `Let(\"x\", Const(15.0), Plus(Ident(\"x\"), Const(20)))` has type __num__. \n",
    "- `FunDef(\"x\", Plus(Ident(\"x\"), Const(10)))` has type __num => num__  or is mistyped, depending on the type of the identifier \"x\".  \n",

    "# Lettuce with Type Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Type annotations are common in many languages such as Java, C/C++, and Scala. For instance, consider the program below:\n",

    "~~~\n",
    "int foo(int y){\n",
    "  int x = 200;\n",
    "  return y + x \n",
    "  }\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The type annotations tell us to expect that \n",
    "- y is an integer\n",
    "- x is an integer\n",
    "- The function foo takes one integer argument and returns an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean that the function is well typed. However, having declared the types, the compiler can\n",
    "more easily check the function and make sure that the declared types match with what the program does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar type annotations are used in Scala programs.\n",

    "## Where should type annotations be added?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the basic problem of where type annotations should be added in a Lettuce program. \n",
    "One way of doing this is to make sure that every identifier that is introduced also has a type annotations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a type annotated lettuce program, is the type annotation correct? To do so, we are going to implement a type checker that uses and checks the type annotation. Thus, we should be able to say things like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "The goal of a type checker is to take in an annotated lettuce program and compute its type. If the program's type is successfully computed, we also conclude that it is well typed and in doing so, we calculate the type of each expression. Therefore, we will define a recursive type checker that calculates the type of an expression:\n",

    "The program is typed correctly. However, the fact that it divides by zero is not part of our type system and we will note that it is in general undecidable. We will call these runtime errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Types and Values\n",
    "\n",
