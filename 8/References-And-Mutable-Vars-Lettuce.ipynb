    "- Mutable variables eg., var in scala that can be assigned.  The assignment of var has a side effect, since it can modify the effect of statements before and after. \n",

    "- Printing, reading from a file, sending a packet to a network, acquiring a lock, .. are all operations that have a side effect. They produce an effect that is observable by the programmer. And thus, we can imagine what the user observes after a print statement to be different from what they observe before a print statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are side effects bad?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the term side effects has a medical connotation that is not desirable, side effects are neither good nor bad. For instance, if the purpose of a program is to maintain a client-server interaction with the user, it is impossible to avoid side effects. However, side effects could make a program harder to comprehend. Often, undocumented side effects frustrate users of libraries who may not have access to the code. Programmers like __modularity__, wherein a program is broken into independent modules that build important parts of the functionality of the program. The program itself is put together by composing these modules. However, side effects make modularity difficult. \n",

It is possible then that B may see that her application is crashing due to out of disk space errors. \n",
    "This is caused by opening files on the disk, which is a side effect.\n",
    "This does not mean that the side effect caused by A's code is avoidable. But it must be understood and documented carefully, so that people who use the code can be aware of it, expect it or deal with it.\n",

    "## Adding Mutable References to Lettuce\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now discuss an extension of lettuce with mutable references. What are mutable references? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Mutable references are addresses to locations in memory that hold a value.  \n",
    "  - For instance, consider memory cell 1 holds the value `NumValue(1.0)`.\n",
    "  - A mutable reference is of the form `Ref(1)`, that tells us that this is a reference to memory address `1` and looking up address 1, we find the value `NumValue(1.0)` stored there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will have an abstraction of memory wherein, the memory has cells numbered 0, 1, 2, ... and each cell can hold a value. This could be a number, a closure, a boolean or another reference (reference to reference!), etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "We will augment Lettuce with three statements:\n",
    "- $NewRef(\\text{value})$, create a new memory cell and place `value` inside it. This returns a reference to the memory cell created.\n",
    "- $DeRef(\\text{reference})$, fetch the value stored in the memory cell that is referenced by `reference`.\n",
    "- $AssignRef(\\text{reference}, \\text{value})$, change the memory cell pointed to by `reference` to have the value `value`. \n",
    "\n",
    "References are very much like pointers in C/C++. However, the main difference is that pointers are very low level. Here our references can store arbitrary (boxed) values inside them. This includes all the values we have encountered thus far: numbers, booleans, closures and references themselves. Therefore, unlike pointers, the size of the memory being pointed to can be variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Grammar of Lettuce with References\n",

    "Some notes\n",
    "- `NewRef` takes in an expression and makes a fresh reference. It them stores the value into this reference.\n",
    "- `DeRef` takes in an expr but as you will see, the expr needs to be a reference or else we will throw an error and bail.\n",
    "- `AssignRef` assigns a reference produced by evaluating its first arugment to the value from the second argument. What should assignment return? This depends on our design:\n",
    "  - We can make AssignRef return nothing and the name for nothing is called \"Unit\" (also called void in languages like C/C++)\n",
    "  - We can make AssignRef evaluate to the actual value that is being assigned. This is common in languages like C/C++\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example in C, we can write\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "  y = x = 10 + 15\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea here is that `x = 10 + 25` evaluates to `25` in addition to having the side effect of assigning `25` to `x`. And thus, the nested assignment assigns `25` to `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `AssignRef` to say the same in Lettuce.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this can be written up in Scala to form our AST."
