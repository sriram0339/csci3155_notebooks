    "# Lettuce: A Language With Let Bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now introduce our first language called _lettuce_, a language with let bindings. This language is inspired by an existing family of languages called `ML` (Meta Language), which has been implemented in general purpose langauges such as `SML`, `OCAML`, `ELM` and so on. The Lettuce language will illustrate the following important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Immutable data: environments\n",
    "- Function calls, closures and recursive functions.\n",
    "- Mutable data through references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about ML family of languages here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build some example programs to understand the central concept in our let language: the _let binding_.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let Bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let bindings allow us to bind an identifier to a value and use it inside a body expression, using the syntax of the following form\n",
    "\n",
    "`let (symbolName) = (defining expression) in (body expression)`\n",
    "\n",
    "_Let's_  practice writing programs in Lettuce (no pun intended).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let x = 3.5 in x + x\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, it defines a symbol named `x`. The defining expression here is `3.5`, and thus evaluates to `3.5`.\n",
    "The body expression is `x + x`. With `x` bound to `3.5`, what does this evaluate to? The answer is `7.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the whole expression can be successively rewritten as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "__eval__ ( \"let x = 3.5 in x + x\") -->Â  __eval__( 3.5 + 3.5 ) --> __eval__ (7.0) -->  7.0\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now nest let bindings  as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let x = 3.0 in \n",
    "    let y = 4.5 - x in \n",
    "        x + 2.0 * y\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "This has two let bindings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Outer binding:\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let x = 3.0 in ((body expression # 1))\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "defines the symbol `x` to the defining expression `3.0` and the body\n",
    "expression \\# 1 is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let y = 4.5 in x + 2.0 * y\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "\n",
    "defines the symbol `y` to the defining expression `4.5 - x` and the body expression \\# 2 is\n",
    "given by ` x + 2.0 * y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have picked it apart, let us evaluate this expression ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__eval__(\"let x = 3.0 in let y = 4.5 - x in x + 2.0 * y\") --> __eval__ (\" let y = 4.5 - 3.0 in 3.0 + 2.0 * y \" ) \n",
    " -->  __eval__(\"let y = 1.5 in 3.0 + 2.0 * y\") --> __eval__ (3.0 + 2.0 * 1.5) --> __eval__(6.0) --> 6.0 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us do one more with a different nesting of let bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let x = ( let y = 5 in y * y )  in  \n",

    "               x - z \n",
    "~~~\n",

    "Thus far we saw body expressions having let bindings. Now we can allow let bindings for the defining expressions as well. \n",

    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let z = 15 * x in x - z\n",

    "\n",
    "~~~\n",
    "let sym = (defining expression) in (body expression)\n",
