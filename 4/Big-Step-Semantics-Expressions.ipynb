    "We wrote a simple and intuitive function `evalExpr` but how do we talk about what it does? A simple answer is that the code can be read by anyone who knows Scala and therefore can serve to document the meaning of expressions in terms of what they do. This is surely a path to disaster for more complicated languages. It is important therefore to use some kind of notation to explain how to understand the behavior of the `evalExpr` function at a high level and in a language independent fashion. We will use \"big step\" semantics to notate this process and see how the code we have written so far is simply a translation of the big step semantics into code.\n",

    "This is subsumed by the Subterm-ERROR rule already stated. In fact, throwing an exception upon encountering an error seems consistent with the semantics written here especially if we map that exception to the value __error__. This will be entirely consistent with the Subterm-ERROR rule that states that if any subterm evaluates to __error__ the expression as a whole also evaluates to an error.\n",

    "## From Big-Step Semantics To Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while big-step semantics are very good at expressing how expressions evaluate to their intended values at a high level, it is not good in expressing issues such as \n",
    "- What is the order of evaluation? For instance we would like to say that if we have an expression `Plus(List(e1,..., em))` we evalute this from left to right, starting with `e1` and ending at `em`.\n",
    "- How do we deal with _side effects? (currently there are no side effects) and so this aspect of our discussion needs to await a future lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "To nail down such issues, we may have to give something called _small step semantics_. However, we will skip small step semantics for now and await such a time when our language has some side effects and mutation, which are both non-issues at present.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let us see how the semantics we have expressed thus far can be translated faithfully into code. Let us make this methodical. We first systematically capture the possible values that an expression can produce. These include the special value `Error` or a `Number`"
