    "## Constructing Programs : Expression Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will take a small step towards understanding how programs are put together: a topic that will keep us busy throughout this class. It is important, as we will see in a minute, because many students are confused about certain aspects of the Scala language given their background in languages such as C/C++ and Python. However, the insights we will develop will go beyond just Scala and apply back to many programming languages. \n",

    "### What is Expression-Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "An expression oriented programming language is one wherein programs are systematically constructed from expressions. Therefore, in these languages, programs are expressions that yield values when evaluated. They are built-up from smaller expressions through various means of \"composition\" of expressions.\n",
